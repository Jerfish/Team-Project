#### Base Structure Example
Whilst initially this was planned to be our base draft, the code section was messy, and could be heavily improved. As it stands, I think it would make a better example and would serve as a good plan for the structure. 
Some points of interest:
* Under the New Problem tab, the horizontal menu is operational, though it doesnt change much.
* Under the New Problem tab, the text detailing a button will also serve that button's purpose if clicked, moving to the next tab or 'submitting'.
* Under the Problem List tab, if you click the header 'Problem List', the text 'Hello there' will appear, serving as an example of how the 'view Problem' functionality may work.
